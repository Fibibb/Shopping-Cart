# Shopping-Cart

A repository holding test cases prepared for the testing of a react-based web application.

## About Page

A site dedicated to the sale of clothing. The website allows us to add products to the basket, increase and decrease their quantity. Products on the site can be filtered by size. 

## Goal

The main reason for setting up the repository was to create test cases and scenarios, prepare test plans and get an overview of the project flow. This resulted in seven test cases covering all the key functionalities of the application. Example view of the application:
